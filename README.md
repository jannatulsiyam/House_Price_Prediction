# House Price Predicton

A simple Python project using **linear regression** to predict house prices based on area (in square feet). This project uses `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to train a basic machine learning model.

## 🧠 How It Works

The model is trained on a small dataset of house areas and their corresponding prices. When the script runs, it prompts the user to input a house area and then predicts the price using the trained linear regression model.
